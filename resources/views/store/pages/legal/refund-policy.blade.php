                        <p>At Vyuga, we strive to ensure your satisfaction with every purchase. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which you may be eligible for a refund. Please review it carefully before making a purchase.<br /><br />

                            <strong>Eligibility for Refunds :</strong> Refunds are available only for defective, damaged, or incorrect items received. Products must be returned within 7 days of delivery in their original conditionâ€”unused, unwashed, and with tags and packaging intact. Non-returnable items include sale products, personalized orders, and items marked as non-refundable.<br /><br />

                            <strong>Refund Process :</strong> To request a refund, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@vyuga.in">info@vyuga.in</a> or call +91-9876543210 within 7 days of delivery. Provide your order number and a brief description of the issue. Once approved, we will initiate a refund to your original payment method within 7-10 business days after receiving the returned item.<br /><br />

                            <strong>Non-Refundable Cases :</strong> Refunds will not be issued for change of mind, incorrect size selection, or items damaged due to improper handling after delivery. Shipping costs are non-refundable unless the error is on our part.<br /><br />

                            <strong>Exchanges :</strong> If you prefer an exchange instead of a refund, we will replace the item with an available equivalent, subject to stock availability. Exchange requests follow the same 7-day return window.<br /><br />

                            <strong>Policy Updates :</strong> Vyuga reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.<br /><br />
